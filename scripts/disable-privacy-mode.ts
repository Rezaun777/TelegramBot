🔧 IMPORTANT: PRIVACY MODE DISABLE INSTRUCTIONS 🔧

To fix your bot not responding in groups, you need to disable privacy mode in BotFather:

1. Open Telegram and go to @BotFather (https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send the command: /setprivacy
3. Select your bot: @showrobtest_bot
4. Choose "Disable" to allow the bot to read all group messages

This is the most common reason why Telegram bots don't respond in groups.

After disabling privacy mode:
1. Add your bot to a group
2. Make it an administrator in the group
3. Test by sending messages that should trigger your bot's responses

Note: You need to do this manually in Telegram as it requires interaction with BotFather.
